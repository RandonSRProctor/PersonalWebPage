# My Personal Webpage

A personal portfolio website built with React and Node.js

<br>

### Overview

<br>

This site was built following a beginner's React tutorial on YouTube.

Unfortunately, the tutorial - while functional - contains many bugs that I have been in the process of fixing.

The page is functional and deployed using Heroku.  You are welcome to see the work-in-progress (links to my demos are active)

### Fixes

<br>

I started by updated the "Contact" page to now be compatible with Sendgrid's API.

There is a routing issue which causes pages to not reload, I have seen this problem with Vue.js before, and am working on a fix.

I also will be updating the code from old paradigms to modern React component syntax.

Please feel free to ask me about what I have changed already and what I have learned in the process!
